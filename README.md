# Linear-Regression-using-python
This code discusses the basics of linear regression and its implementation in Python. Linear regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.
It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value'y' as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable'x'.
The task is to find a line which fits best the scatter plot so that we can predict the response for any new feature values. This line is called the regression line.
